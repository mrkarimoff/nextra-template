We ask you to please cite us in publications or presentations that are created from any research, clinical, educational, or other applicable use of the Network Canvas Suite or any of its components. Through your citation of the software, we are able to measure its impact and track the ways in which it is being used.

### Primary Citation

Studies that have used Network Canvas to capture data from their study participants should cite the Interviewer software itself. If this is the case we recommend:

>Complex Data Collective. Network Canvas Interviewer. 2016. www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6026548
{:.citation}

A BibTeX entry for LaTex users is:

```
   @misc{network-canvas,
      organization = {Complex Data Collective}, 
      title        = {Network Canvas: Interviewer},
      url          = {https://github.com/complexdatacollective/Interviewer}
      year         = 2016
      doi          = https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6026548
    }
```

#### Architect and Server

When wishing to specifically reference Architect or Server, you may use:
